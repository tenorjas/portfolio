      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Back-end developer specializing in C#/.NET.  Learned my coding skills at The Iron Yard coding academy, from which I graduated in September, 2017.  Previously worked as a broadcast consulting engineer for twelve years, during which I helped radio and TV stations optimize their coverage, minimize interference with other broadcast facilities, select optimal channels/frequencies through allocation studies, and ensure that the station's environmental impact complied with FCC regulations, including human exposure to radiofrequency radiation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am also a musician.  My musical background includes being the Cantor of Congregation B'nai Israel in St. Petersburg, Florida, performance experience in operas, operettas, musicals and with contemporary a cappella groups. Instruments include guitar, violin and hand drums.</p>

        <h2>Mystery Word</h2>
        <img src="mystery_word_selection.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>In Mystery Word, a random word is chosen from the computer's dictionary.  The program then displays blanks equal to the number of letters in the word.  The player guesses one letter at a time, and is allowed eight wrong guesses.  If the letter guessed appears in the mystery word, every instance of that letter appears in place of the respective blanks.  If the letter guessed does not appear in the mystery word, the number of wrong guesses remaining is reduced by one.  If the player guesses a letter that he has already guessed, the program displays a message informing the player that he has already guessed that letter, and the number of guesses remaining is not reduced.  If the player completes the word before he runs out of guesses, he wins.</p>

        <h2>Dinosaurs</h2>
        <img src="dinos_screenshot.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>This program contains an array of objects, and each object contains information about a dinosaur.  The home page shows each dinosaur's name and photograph.  From the home page, the user can click on each dinosaur's name and be redirected to a detail page, which also shows the dinosaur's weight and habitats.</p>
        <p>The home page also contains a form at the bottom through which a user may add a dinosaur to the data set.  Additionally, each dinosaur's details page contains a form that allows the user to edit the data for that dinosaur.</p>

        <h2>StackUnderflow</h2>
        <img src="stackunderflow_screenshot.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>StackUnderflow is a site where authenticated users (i.e. registered users who have an account) can post questions which they would like answered by other users.  The home page displays each question's title, body, the user id of the user who posted the question, and the date and time that the question was posted.  When an authenticated user goes to a question's details page, he may post an answer to the question.  The answer then appears on that question's details page, along with the date and time posted.  All of the data is contained in a Postgres database.</p>
