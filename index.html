      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Back-end developer specializing in C#/.NET.  Learned my coding skills at The Iron Yard coding academy, from which I graduated in September, 2017.  Previously worked as a broadcast consulting engineer for twelve years, during which I helped radio and TV stations optimize their coverage, minimize interference with other broadcast facilities, select optimal channels/frequencies through allocation studies, and ensure that the station's environmental impact complied with FCC regulations, including human exposure to radiofrequency radiation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am also a musician.  My musical background includes being the Cantor of Congregation B'nai Israel in St. Petersburg, Florida, performance experience in operas, operettas, musicals and with contemporary a cappella groups. Instruments include guitar, violin and hand drums.</p>

        <h2>Mystery Word</h2>
        <img src="mystery_word_selection.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>In Mystery Word, a random word is chosen from the computer's dictionary.  The program then displays blanks equal to the number of letters in the word.  The player guesses one letter at a time, and is allowed eight wrong guesses.  If the letter guessed appears in the mystery word, every instance of that letter appears in place of the respective blanks.  If the letter guessed does not appear in the mystery word, the number of wrong guesses remaining is reduced by one.  If the player guesses a letter that he has already guessed, the program displays a message informing the player that he has already guessed that letter, and the number of guesses remaining is not reduced.  If the player completes the word before he runs out of guesses, he wins.</p>
